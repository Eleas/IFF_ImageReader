# IFF_ImageReader
A class that allows for the opening and parsing of IFF images


## What's an IFF image?

IFF, or Interchange File Format, is a datatype developed by Electronic Arts for use on the Commodore Amiga. Its most common usage was as an image format, but it is a container that can actually hold anything. It is easily parsable, explicable, and well-formed. The full name of the image format is actually IFF ILBM (meaning InterLeaved BitMap).

## Why write an IFF reader?

Because I always wanted to, and now I can.
